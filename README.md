## Description of the program is This program is designed to perform lexical analysis on a given source code stored in a text file (input.txt).Keywords (e.g., int, if, while), Operators (e.g., +, -, =, >), Identifiers (e.g., variable names like a, count), Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler, where the input source code is scanned and broken into meaningful tokens for further processing.Tools used while making this code Terminal / Command Prompt	Running the compiled program.input.txt file	Providing source code for lexical analysis.VS code is used for this program. Basic explaination of this code Opens the input.txt file containing sample C code ,Keywords using a fixed list (int, float, etc.).Identifiers as variable names (alphabetic/alphanumeric starting with a letter).Operators like +, -, *, /, =.Prints the classification results to the console.THis code is applicable for Compiler Design	Fundamental step in building a compiler (lexical analysis phase).Programming Education for Helps students understand how compilers tokenize source code, Language Processing for Useful in interpreters, static analyzers, and code linters.Security for  Code Auditing	Basic foundation for tools that scan code for vulnerabilities. These are the descripttion of that program.
